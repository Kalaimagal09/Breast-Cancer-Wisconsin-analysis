# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-analysis

Binary Classification with Logistic Regression ðŸ©º
This project demonstrates the implementation of a logistic regression model to perform binary classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The goal is to build a classifier that can accurately predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on its features.

## Workflow Overview
Data Preparation: The dataset was loaded and preprocessed. Features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they were on a comparable scale.

Model Training: A LogisticRegression model from Scikit-learn was trained on the prepared data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance was thoroughly evaluated using a suite of classification metrics.

## Key Concepts & Skills ðŸ§ 
This project covers several fundamental concepts in machine learning and classification:

Building a binary classifier.

Implementing a robust evaluation strategy using:

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

ROC Curve and AUC Score

Understanding the Sigmoid Function and its role in predicting probabilities.

The practical application of tuning the classification threshold to balance precision and recall.

## Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn
